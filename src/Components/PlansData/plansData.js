      description: "An earthquake is the sudden release of strain energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in waves of shaking that radiate outwards from the earthquake source. When stresses in the crust exceed the strength of the rock, it breaks along lines of weakness, either a pre-existing or new fault plane. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and can trigger landslides and tsunamis. Preparedness and early warning systems are crucial in mitigating the impact of earthquakes and ensuring safety during such events.",
