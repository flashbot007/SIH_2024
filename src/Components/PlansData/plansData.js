    description:
      "An earthquake is the sudden release of strain energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in waves of shaking that radiate outwards from the earthquake source. When stresses in the crust exceed the strength of the rock, it breaks along lines of weakness, either a pre-existing or new fault plane. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and can trigger landslides and tsunamis. Preparedness and early warning systems are crucial in mitigating the impact of earthquakes and ensuring safety during such events.",

    description:
      "A fire can spread rapidly, engulfing everything in its path within minutes. It can be caused by various factors like electrical faults, unattended flames, or natural events like lightning. To prevent fires, regularly inspect electrical wiring, avoid overloading circuits, and keep flammable materials away from heat sources. Install smoke alarms and fire extinguishers in key areas of your home. In case of a fire, stay low to avoid smoke inhalation, and exit the building immediately. Never use elevators during a fire. If your clothes catch fire, remember to stop, drop, and roll to extinguish the flames.",

    description:
      "Floods are among the most common and devastating natural disasters, often resulting from heavy rainfall, melting snow, or dam failures. To prevent flood damage, ensure proper drainage around your home, elevate electrical systems, and consider using water-resistant building materials. Stay informed about weather conditions, and if you live in a flood-prone area, have an evacuation plan in place. During a flood, avoid walking or driving through floodwaters, and move to higher ground. Afterward, avoid contact with potentially contaminated floodwater, and inspect your home for structural damage before re-entering.",

    description:
      "Landslides occur when large masses of rock, earth, or debris move down a slope, often triggered by heavy rain, earthquakes, or human activities like deforestation. To prevent landslides, avoid cutting down trees and vegetation on slopes, ensure proper drainage systems to reduce water buildup, and avoid construction near steep slopes. In landslide-prone areas, stay alert to warning signs like cracks in the ground or leaning trees. If a landslide occurs, evacuate immediately to higher, stable ground. Afterward, be cautious of secondary landslides and check for potential hazards like downed power lines.",
